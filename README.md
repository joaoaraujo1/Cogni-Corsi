# Cogni-Corsi
A neurocognitive stimulation app targeting selective attention, visuospatial search, working memory and executive functioning

Available training customizations:

1) Cues: Choose a number of cues ranging from numbers, letters, symbols and colours to train memorization

2) Modality: Choose the modality of the instruction presentation from visual (with or without masking) to auditive (for simultaneous multi-modal attention span training).

3) Response condition: You can choose to add a rule to your response in order to make the user recall only a subset of the elements he coded. If you add a rule you can, for instance, after the instruction presentation, ask the subject to recall only the squares that had even numbers.

4) Response order: You can choose to make the user recall the stimulus presented by the correct order or by the inverse order.
